# ------------------

cawk objective is to provide to the community a complete list of tests allowing
to check network configurations whatever the supplier. moreover, cawk is ONLY 
based on two simple packages: 
- gnu gmake
- gawk these 

these two packages are very powerful and the cawk project intend to ONLY use these two 
packages. No other langage, no database, etc. keep things simple and understandable for 
the whole. In summary, in gawk we trust :-)

cawk project allows the community to easily add their own test and their configuration 
associated to. cawk enforces high level of granularity to build a test.

# ------------------

cawk has the following directories:
- common  : contain a <kind of library> (set of functions) including in the tests

- tests   : a collection of individual tests *.template per supplier

	- to allow portability, each tests refer to GENERIC_ID to be changed in each
	environment aka:
		- COMMON_PATH = to point out the common <kind of library>
		- GAWK_PATH = to point out the right path for gawk 
		(ref Makefile)
	- to allow easy tests writting, each test may refer to GENERIC_ID aka:
		- %BLOCK_JUNIPER% : space identation used for block hierarchy
		(ref support/tests.sed)

	a test has an initial <.template> suffix, once converted to be exe, the
	test has the <.gawk> suffix

	each supplier test (cisco-ios, etc) is divided into two part:
		- repo : this is the cawk collection of tests (gmake check_repo to launch)
		- run : only put tests that apply to your environment (gmake check_run to launch)

- confs   : a collection of configurations per supplier

- report  : assessment performed by the tests on the configurations

- support : contains files helping for building cawk:
	- tests.sed : used when building the tests making change on GENERIC_ID

# ------------------

cawk in gmake targets:
	- gmake clean : clean all 
	- gmake tests : build all tests
	- gmake check_repo : assess the confs with <repo> tests
	- gmake check_run : assess the confs with <run> tests
	- gmake catalog : list the tests linked to <repo> or <run>

# ------------------

if someone intends to submit a test and a configuration associated to, if approved, 
then the test  will added to the package and the name of author will be added to 
the AUTHORS list.
