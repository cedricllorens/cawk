# ---- introduction
# -----------------

cawk objective is to provide to the community a complete list of tests allowing to check 
network configurations whatever the supplier. Moreover, cawk is ONLY based on two well-known
packages: 
- gnu gmake
- gawk these 

These two packages are very powerful today and the cawk project intend to ONLY use these two 
packages. No other langage, no database, no configure, etc. cawk try to keep things simple 
and understandable for the whole. In summary, in gawk && gmake we trust :-) (perhaps because 
i was using awk in the 1986 years !!).

cawk project allows the community to easily add their own test and their configuration associated 
to. cawk enforces a high level of granularity to allow everyone to build a test.

# ----------------------
# ---- cawk installation
# ----------------------

you may have to change the file support/tests.sed for finding the gawk path at your system level
required for buidling tests:
	-%SED_GAWK_PATH% = to point out the right path for gawk 
	( we set <!/usr/bin/env -S gawk -f> for a generic finding )

# ---------------------
# ---- cawk directories
# ---------------------

cawk has the following directories:

- common  : contain a <kind of library> (set of functions) including in the tests and others common
useful scripts

- tests   : a collection of individual tests *.template per supplier :

	- each supplier test (cisco-ios, etc) is divided into two part:
		- repo : this is the cawk collection of tests 
		(gmake tests_repo && check_repo to launch)
		- run  : used to put tests (from repo) that apply to your environment 
		(gmake tests_run && check_run to launch)

	- a tests has <.template> suffix, but the test is converted to <.gawk> suffix thanks to
	the file support/tests.sed. this change allows to write tests more easily && enforce env 
	system portability, so each test refer to %SED_VAR% aka:

		- %SED_BLOCK_JUNIPER% : space identation used for block hierarchy
		- %SED_COMMON_PATH% = to point out the common <kind of library>
		- %SED_GAWK_PATH% = to point out the right path for gawk 
		etc.

		these values can be changed thanks to the file support/tests.sed

- confs   : a collection of configurations per supplier

- report  : assessment reports (and summary), each report has a same format:
	- name of the configuration
	- name of the test
	- error description
	- line number where the error has been found in the configuration
	- risklevel 
	- <pass> or <error> states

- support : contains files helping for building cawk:
	- tests.sed : used when building the tests in order to make change of the set %SED_VAR%

# -----------------------
# ---- cawk gmake targets
# -----------------------

cawk in gmake targets:
	- gmake			: provide information on cawk running
	- gmake supplier	: provides the suppliers supported by cawk
	- gmake clean 		: clean all 
	- gmake tests_run 	: build all <repo> tests
	- gmake tests_repo 	: build all <repo> tests
	- gmake check_repo 	: assess the confs with <repo> tests
	- gmake check_run 	: assess the confs with <run> tests
	- gmake view		: view assessment reports (and summary)
	  or gmake view supplier=cisco-ios (or juniper-junos, etc.)
	- gmake catalog 	: list the tests linked to <repo> or <run>

	note : gmake clean check_repo view allows to launch a full <repo> assessment

# -------------------
# ---- cawk community
# -------------------

if someone intends to submit a test and a configuration associated to, if approved, then the 
test will added to the package and the name of author will be added to the AUTHORS list.
