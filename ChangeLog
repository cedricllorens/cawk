v3.2.0 (December 2025):
	Makefile:
	- add a new variable that can be called with gmake like:
		gmake check_run audit=<AUDIT_NAME> PSIRT=yes : only compute PSIRT tests if you intend to build an audit only for psirt purpose
		gmake check_run audit=<AUDIT_NAME> PSIRT=no (dfault value) : compute all the tests
		(ref Makefile.support.mk file)
	- fix a bug in database.repo copy to database
	Docker:
	- 3 new files have been added to build a cawk container based on:
		- Makefile.docker file, 
		- Dockerfile file, 
		- cawk_docker_run.sh script
		(please refer to the README for further information)

v3.1.0 (October 2025):
	Makefile:
	- add a new script <database_sync_psirt.sh> in <database/scripts> in order to build psirt inventory
	  (this script is runned with <sync_psirt> target)
	  (refer to README for further information)
	- add a new target <sync_psirt> target to build psirt inventory
	- add a new target <database_repo_copy> allowing to update <database> directory only with missing 
	  files (database.repo -> database), this target is runned with <migrate> target
	  (refer to README for further information)
	- fix a bug with $(ECHO) -e command (not portable and printing "-e" in files)
	- fix a bug with <backup_audit_run> find command (-type f -o -type d not portable, database not fully backup)
	- update database_sync with a new option regex_path_exclude in order to exclude configurations based on their
	  paths, all associated cawk files have been updated
	Tests:
	- add advanced psirt test code allowing to match line, block, os version, etc.
	  - one advanced psirt code has been added for cisco-ios, cisco-xe, cisco-viptela and cisco-xr
	  - it is built over <common/test_generic_psirt.gawk.template> v1.0 code
	  - such psirt test has <.gawk.include> suffix
	- <username> test is now available for cisco-xe supplier scope
	- all cisco-ios tests are now available for cisco-xe supplier scope

v3.0.0 (October 2025):
	Makefile:
	- update Makefile in order to have a new type of test allowing to check advanced psirt vulnerabilities 
	  (statements match, ios versions regex match, chassis regex match, etc.) in a future release
	- update Makefile to support running cawk as a Docker container in a future release
	- enforce Makefile controls during processing
	- set a <EGREP variable> in Makefile.support.mk for pointing to <grep -E> rather than to <egrep>
	- add a new target <clean_archive_older> to remove archive files older than the ARCHIVE_OLDER_DAYS value defined in Makefile.support.mk
	- <sync_run target> update 
	  - to add a new regex allowing to match os supplier during the sync
	  (refer to README for further information)
	  - remove the confs directories by default and create only the ones linked to existing configurations
	  (refer to README for further information)
	Tests:
	- <banner> tests are now available for all cisco supplier scopes
	- <enable password> tests are now available for all cisco supplier scopes
	- <logging> tests are now available for all cisco supplier scopes

v2.9.0 (September 2025):
	Makefile:
	- improved test execution performance by allowing multiple configuration files per test run
	  (this option can be changed in Makefile.support.mk with the TEST_EXE variable)
	- general performance improvements (.INTERMEDIATE and *.swap for all scopes)
	- add a new target gmake version to display the current cawk version
	- add two targets gmake tests_check and tests_check_nok to check the compliance validity of all tests
	Tests:
	- add a banner test for cisco-ios scope only (to be replicated for other scopes in future releases)
	- updated tests for older crypto algorithms across all supplier scopes (ref support/tests.sed)
	- fixed all inconsistent test output names and include an internal check before package release. 
	  note that some tests names have changed to be more consistent (it could impact existing exceptions)
	  (ref common/check_test.gawk.template will check test consistency and format compliance)
	  (inconsisstencies can be checked directly with gmake tests_check and gmake tests_check_nok targets)

v2.8.0 (July 2025):
	Makefile:
	- in reports, include the number of exceptions in the summary report
	- in reports, include the number of deadbeef configurations in the summary report

	- in view_error and view_run targets, simplify the output
	- in targets tests_run_copy and tests_run_audit_copy, add a check to avoid copying files that already exist in run_audit
	Tests:
	- for the following suppliers scopes : cisco-ios, cisco-xe and cisco-cedge, update global tests to take into consideration 
	the default commands (hidden commands), avoiding to set many exceptions for each supplier scope assessment
	- for the following suppliers scopes : cisco-ios, cisco-xe, update line aux tests to take into consideration that other 
	line commands can be defined for modem, etc.
	Common:
	- review code of timeline reporting to enhance performance

v2.7.0 (June 2025):
	Makefile:
		- in reports:
			- rename ".all.full." substring to ".all." substring for the final reports
			- build *.idx (index of configurations assessed)
			- build a new final psirt report (.all(.security./.audit./.psirt./.exception./.deadbeef.)) gathering 
			all psirt errors
			- build a timeline report for each final report (.all(.security./.audit./.psirt./.exception./.deadbeef.))
			that could be injected into Microsoft PowerBI, Grafana, etc. as it includes a timestamp header for each error 
			(year, month, day, week, number of devices assessed)
			- for the final reports, the concept of deadbeef can be activated in Makefile.support.mk or by calling 
			gmake with DEADBEEF like (gmake check_run audit=cawk DEADBEEF=yes):
				- if DEADBEEF is set to "yes", then the deadbeef final report is generated and deadbeef devices 
				are removed from other final reports (.all.security.,.all.audit.,.all.psirt.,all.exception.)
				- if DEADBEEF is set to "no", then the deadbeef final report is generated and deadbeef devices 
				are kept in other final reports (.all.security.,.all.audit.,.all.psirt.,all.exception.)
				- a device is considered deadbeef by default if its configuration is older than the days value 
				set in DEADBEEF_THRESHOLD_DAYS (default value is 30 days)
		- in backup_run target, enforce that logs/run_audit/AUDIT_NAME logs are also backed up in the gzipped 
		file (needed for cawk version migration)
		- in migrate target, enforce the copy of tests by several finds rather than a single find command which can 
		generate issues at some systems
