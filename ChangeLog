	- Run and fix bugs on all suppliers tests

v1.6.0 (june 2024):
	Common:
	- migrate the fw rules assessment library in common directory
	- add the <research> as supplier target for development purpose
	- add a new risk level = info for audit purpose
	- update reporting to take into consideration the new risk level info and sort the list of tests
	Tests:
	- add new tests checking cisco-ios simple acl with risk level info and add other tests
	- add new tests checking huawei-vrp acl (partially done) with risk level info and add other tests
	- add ntp tests for cisco-ios,juniper-junos,huawei-vrp,cisco-viptela and nokia-sros

v1.5.0 (may 2024):
	Common:
	- add new Makefile target <view_error> to only view assessments errors
	Tests:
	- review all the tests and fix some bugs
	For future release:
	- work on firewall rules analysis in order to find redundant && inconsistent rules
	- progress for cisco-ios scope
	(i.e. research directory, only for dvt/test purpose) 

v1.4.0 (april 2024):
	Common:
	- remove the init target in generated parallel Makefile built to avoid missing tests and silent mode
	- enhance reporting with high, medium, low and review % computation with float
	System:
	- remove colors and add OK/NOK for gmake system (portability purpose)
	Tests:
	- add tests for cisco-ios,juniper-junos,huawei-vrp,cisco-viptela and nokia-sros
	For future release:
	- work on firewall rules analysis in order to find redundant && inconsistent rules
	(i.e. research directory, only for dvt/test purpose) 
	
v1.3.0 (march 2024):
	Makefile:
	- add Makefile.support.mk in order to set make options (i.e. cawk parallel mode)
	- update Makefile to turn on cawk in parallel mode
	- add a new <system> target to check if the system is ready to run cawk
	Tests:
	- add tests for all suppliers (fix some tests outputs / reporting)
	- add cisco-viptela supplier
	For next release:
	- work on analysis firewall rules to find redundant && inconsistent rules
	(research directory, only for dvt/test purpose) 

v1.2.0 (march 2024):
	Makefile:

	Tests:
	- update all tests purposes with similar syntax
	- add tests for all suppliers
	- add paloalto-panos supplier
	For next release:
	- work to generate a Makefile that can runned in parallel, enforcing stable system and managing write race conditions
	(commmon/gen_cawk_makefile.gawk.template), it will be used for huge number of devices assessment

v1.1.0 (february 2024):
	Makefile:
	- add new suppliers for future tests and add os suffix for each scope
	- add view per scope thanks to <supplier=> variable called with view target
	  gmake clean check_repo supplier=cisco-ios (or juniper-junos, etc.)
	  gmake clean check_run supplier=cisco-ios (or juniper-junos, etc.)
	  gmake view supplier=cisco-ios (or juniper-junos, etc.)
	Tests:
	- add tests in existing suppliers and configure a better writting approach for matching block
	- add nokia-sros supplier

v1.0.0 (february 2024): initial version
