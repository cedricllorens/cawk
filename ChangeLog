v2.5.0 (april 2025):
	Tests:
		- add a new scope : 6wind-linux
		- review the risk level and status codes of all *defref* tests
	Cawk Makefile: 
	  - by default reporting is linked to each supplier scope. now, in addition of the default reporting, a full reporting is 
		  generated for all suppliers allowing to generate a full report, security report, audit report and summary report.
		- generate cawk msg (only for assessment audit=AUDIT_NAME) when confs or tests directories are not found. it allows to 
		  remove unused directories if needed. 
		- add new targets to manage email notifications for cawk assessments, it refers to database_email_(add,del,update), 
		  email_send(_audit)? targets (please refer to the README for further information)
		- update gmake database_sync_(add,update) audit=AUDIT_NAME dir=SYNC_PATH regex=REGEX_PATTERN/.* scope=SCOPE_FILE/none
		  a scope can be provided to limit the configuration synchronization to a specific scope based on internal inventory
			(please refer to the README for further information)
		- fix some bugs when using view targets
	Cawk Makefile.support.mk:
		- JSON var is set to "no" by default, if set to "yes" json reporting is activated (i.e. Makefile.support.mk)
	Cawk directories:
		- add a log directory to store all cawk logs

	Reports:
	- computation of two key security indicators in the summary report:
		- security Compliance : expressed as a percentage between 0% and 100%, where 100% is the best score

	- generate automatically json reports from csv reports using the cawk assessment format (ref README)
	- generate automatically json reports from txt summary reports using the cawk summary headers
	Cawk makefile:
	- automatically build a tar.gz file in archives directory in reports/repo or reports/run or reports/run_AUDIT_NAME
	  each time an assessment is runned, the date of day is part of the tar.gz filename
	- you may clean reports or archives by new clean targets (clean_report_repo, ..., clean_archive_repo, ...), please
	  refer to the cawk gmake help

v2.2.0 (february 2025):

		- gmake create_audit audit=AUDIT_NAME
		- gmake delete_audit audit=AUDIT_NAME
		- gmake list_audit
		You may refer to README for further information and the number of assessments that can be built is limited by system resources
